Google Siri Server!

I am the host of Google Siri Server and this is where i will post my plugins.

 

UDID Detection
The UDID detection is new and is being worked on so there may be a few issues but you can always contact me on twitter @byrnecal but the code will be updated as soon as i have fixed any errors and there is a howto guide in the UDID folder

Plugins
This is where i will place and update the plugins to the new versions once updates have been made
